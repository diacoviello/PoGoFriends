# PoGo Friends

## Introduction

> In the world of Pokemon Go, as in most video games, there are XP (experience points) requirements for players to level up. At this time, the most efficient way to level up involves daily interactions with your in game friends, because once you both hit "Best Friends" status, and with a 'lucky egg' deployed, you and your friend can get 200k xp in one shot! Lucky eggs double the xp accumulated, but cost money, so ideally we want to be able to line up *when* we hit Best Friend status with our friends so that we can make as many of them happen all at once.<p> In game right now, it is not an easy thing to be able to track, and even more confusing when you try and implement a system and miss a day. This application will be for users to monitor and keep track of how far along they are with all of their friends, and coordinate when to open gifts in order to maximize xp output on one lucky egg.

### Project Goals
>Create an online application that users can manually input their Pokemon Go friends and be able to track their friendship progress daily to maximize XP rewards and save money on 'Lucky Eggs'.
- Users can log in and obtain saved information from the previous day. 
- Users can add or subtract the number of day interactions to monitor their progress.
- Users can add or delete friends to this application.
- Users can see a list of all their friends added and sort them.
